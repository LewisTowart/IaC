# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Helps us codify all things related to infrastructure. Can write a language we can read that can instruct the machines and execute tasks accordingly.

An example is being to automate the process of SSHing into the VM and installing packages or running commands like update and upgrade.

Another example would be to automate the process of launching instances, VNet and settings things such as security groups.
