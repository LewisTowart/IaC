# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Helps us codify all things related to infrastructure. You can write a language that is human readable which will instruct the machines to execute tasks accordingly.

An example is being able to automate the process of SSHing into the VM and installing packages or running commands like update and upgrade. (Configuration Management)

Another example would be to automate the process of launching instances, VNet and settings things such as security groups. (Orchestration)

Overall, Infrastructure as Code improves efficiency, reliability and agility in managing infrastructure. This enables organisations to deliver applications and software faster and more effectively.
